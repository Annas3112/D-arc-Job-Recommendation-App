For the architecture we chose Cloud Run as the platform for deploying APIs and Machine Learning models, while Container Registry is used to store Dockerfiles to simplify container management.

In addition, we utilized Firebase to configure the Firestore database, providing high reliability and scalability in dataÂ management.
